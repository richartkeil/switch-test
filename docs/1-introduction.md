# Introduction

Exposify Switch is a service that lets you easily distribute
real estate data to different platforms. Send your data once â€“ 
publish it on all the platforms.

If you are building a real estate application you often need 
to bring offers to platforms like Immobilienscout24, Immowelt 
or Ebay Kleinanzeigen. Some of them have their own API, some 
of them use OpenImmo. Some use old FTP servers to transfer data, 
some complicated OAuth flows.

Switch exposes one beautiful API so you don't have to worry 
about all of that.
